# 0.3 -- Introduction to C/C++
## Before C++, there was C
- The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language.
## C++
- C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979.
- C++ is a superset of C, though this is not strictly true.
- C++'s most notable innovation over C is that it supports object-oriented programming.
- C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee. This means the ISO standards committee approved a document (called a *standards document*) that provides a formal description of the C++ language. The goal of standardization is to help ensure that C++ code behaves consistently across different compilers and platforms.
## C and C++'s philosophy
- The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as "trust the programmer" -- which is both wonderful and dangerous.
- This is one of the primary reasons why knowing what you shouldn't do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.
### Q: What is C++ good at?
- C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed.
### Q: Isn't C++ dying?
- Nope.
### Q: Do I need to know C before I do these tutorials?
- Nope.
