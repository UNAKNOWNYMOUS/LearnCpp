# 0.5 -- Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries
## Step 4: Compiling your source code
- In order to compile C++ source code files, we use a C++ compiler.
- The C++ compiler sequentially goes through each source code (.cpp) file in your program does two important tasks:
  - The compiler checks your C++ code to make sure it follows the rules of the C++ language.
  - The compiler translates your C++ code into machine language instructions.
    - These instructions are stored in an intermediate file called an *object file*.
- Object files are typically named `name.o` or `name.obj`, where name is the same name as the .cpp file it was produced from.
## Step 5: Linking object files and libraries and creating the desired output file
- After the compiler has successfully finished, another program called the *linker* kicks in.
- The liner's job is to combine all of the object files and produce the desired output file (such as an executable file that you can run).
  - This process is called linking.
- The linker:
  - First, reads each object files generated by the compiler and makes sure they are valid.
  - Second, the linker ensures all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly.
  - Third, the linker typically links in one or more *library files*.
## The standard library
- C++ comes with an extensive library called the *C++ Standard Library* (usually called "the standard library") that provides a set of useful capabilities for use in your programs.
- Most C++ linkers are configured to link in the standard library be default, so this generally isn't something you need to worry about.
## 3rd party libraries
- You can optionally link *third party libraries*, which are libraries that are created and distributed by independent entities (rather than as part of the C++ standard).
## Building
- Because there are multiple steps involved, the term *building* is often used to refer to the full process of converting source code files into an executable that can be run.
- A specific executable produced as the result of building is sometimes called a *build*.
## Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging
- *Testing* is the process of assessing whether your software is working as expected.
  - Basic testing typically involves trying different input combinations to ensure the software behaves correctly in different cases.
- If the program does not behave as expected, then you will have to do some *debugging*, which is the process of finding and fixing programming errors.
