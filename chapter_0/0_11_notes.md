# 0.11 -- Configuring your compiler: Warning and error levels
- When you write your programs, the compiler will check to ensure you've followed the rules of the C++ language.
- If you have done something that definitively violates the rules of the language, then your program is *ill-formed*.
- In most cases, when the compiler encounters some kind of issue, it will emit *diagnostic message* (often called a *diagnostic* for short).
- The C++ standard does not define how diagnostic messages should be categorized, worded, or how those issues should affect the compilation of the program.
- However, modern compilers have conventionally adopted the following:
  - A *diagnostic error* (*error* for short) means the compiler has decided to halt compilation, because it either cannot proceed or deems the error serious enough to stop. Diagnostic errors generated by the compiler are often called *compilation errors*, *compiler errors*, or *compile errors*.
  - A *diagnostic warning* (*warning* for short) means the compiler has decided not to halt compilation. In such cases, the issue is simply ignored, and compilation proceeds.
### Key insight
- Compilers determine whether a non-blocking issue is a warning or an error. While they usually align in their categorization, in some cases, compilers may not agree -- with one compiler emitting an error and another compiler emitting a warning for the same issue.
### For advanced readers
#### Best practice
- Don't let warnings pile up. Resolve them as you encounter them (as if they were errors). Otherwise a warning about a serious issue may be lost amongst warning about non-serious issues.
## Increasing your warning levels
#### Best practice
- Turn your warning levels up, especially while you are learning. The additional diagnostic may help in identifying programming mistakes that can cause your program to malfunction.
### For Visual Studio users
### For Code::Blocks users
### For gcc users
- Add the following flags to your command line: `-Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion`
### For VS Code users
## Treat warnings as errors
#### Best practice
- Enable "Treat warnings as errors". This will force you to resolve all issues causing warnings.
### For Visual Studio users
### For Code::Blocks users
### For gcc users
- Add the following flag to your command line: `-Werror`
### For VS Code users
