# 0.7 -- Compiling your first program
## Projects
- A *project* is a container that holds all of your source code files, images, data files, etc... that are needed to produce an executable (or library, website, etc...) that you can run or use.
### Best practice
- Create a new project for each new program you write
## Console projects
- A *console project* means that we are going to create programs that can be run from Windows, Linux, or Mac consoles.
## Workspaces / solutions
- A workspace or solution is a container that can hold one or more related projects.
## Writing your first program
## Creating a project in Visual Studio 2019 (or newer)
### Q: What are precompiled headers and why are we turning them off?
- In larger projects (those with many code files), precompiled headers can improve compilation speed by avoiding redundant compilation that tends to occur in larger projects.
## Creating a project in Visual Studio 2017 or older
## Visual Studio Solution Explorer
### Q: I got error C1010 ("fatal error C1010: unexpected end of file while looking for precompiled header. Did you forget to add '#include "stdafx.h"' to your source?"). What now?

- A *cache* (pronounced like "cash") is storage location where frequently accessed data is stored for fast retrieval later.
