# 0.6 -- Installing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- An *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)* is a piece of software designed to make it easy to develop, build, and debug your programs.
## Choosing an IDE
## Visual Studio (for Windows)
## Code::Blocks (for Linux or Windows)
### Q: What do I do if I get a "Can't find compiler executable in your configured search paths for GNU GCC Compiler" error?
## Visual Studio Code (for experienced Linux, macOS, or Windows users)
## Other macOS IDEs
## Other compilers or platforms
### Q: can I use a web-based compiler?
### Q: Can I use a command-line compiler (e.g. g++ on Linux)?
### Q: Can I use other code editors or IDEs, such as Eclipse, Sublime, or Notepad++?
## IDEs to avoid
## When things go wrong (a.k.a when IDE stands for "I don't even...")
## Moving on
